# Library-Management-System-Website
Welcome to the Library Management System project! This web application serves as a comprehensive solution for managing library operations efficiently. Built using JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, this system facilitates seamless interaction between users and librarians, enabling smooth book browsing, reviewing, issuing, returning, and fine management.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure user authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure that only authorized individuals, both users and librarians, can access the system's functionalities.

Fine Management: To enforce timely returns, the system enables librarians to impose fines for late submissions. This feature helps maintain discipline among users and ensures the availability of resources for others.

User Reviews: Enhancing the user experience, individuals can leave reviews and ratings for books they have read, enabling others to make informed decisions about their reading selections.

Book Issuance and Returns: Librarians have the authority to manage book loans efficiently. They can issue books to users, record loan transactions, and handle returns seamlessly.
